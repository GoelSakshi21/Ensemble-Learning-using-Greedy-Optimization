# Ensemble-Learning-using-Greedy-Optimization
Ensemble learning is a ML approach in which we combine several ML models to get an optimized model. Through this project we are trying to apply the concept of Greedy Optimization Algorithms to get better accuracy through ensemble Modelling. We are using pruning (removing models from the ensemble until there is no improvement) and growing (adding models to the ensemble until there is no further improvement) concept to reduce the complexity and increase accuracy. By using this concept, we were able to increase the accuracy from 0.82 to 0.84. Also, it had less complexity than the normal ensemble.
